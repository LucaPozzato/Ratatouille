Warm up your croissants at about 180 degrees in a preheated oven for about 5 minutes. \n\n2. Cut the croissants on one side to create a pocket.\n\n3. Fill the croissant with Nutella (use as much as you prefer).\n\n4. For the corn cream sauce, open up the can of Bonduelle Gold Zlat\u00e1 Kukurica / Canned corn and drain the water.\n\n5. Heat a pan. Add the canned corn and cook for about 3-5 minutes.\n\n6. Lower the heat, add Panna da cucina (heavy cream) to the corn and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Let the corn combination cool.\n\n7. Once cooled, start blending the corn and cream mix till it turns into a smooth paste.\n\n8. Drizzle your corn cream sauce on top of your Nutella filled croissants before serving.\n\nEnjoy your sweet and savoury treat!\n\nAs a note, the \"Pane morbido di grano duro - Esselunga - 400 g\" is a type of bread and the \"San Benedetto th\u00e8 Limone deteinato 0,5\" is a type of lemon tea. These ingredients don't quite fit into the suggested recipe and are hence, optional. On a side note, you can definitely enjoy the lemon tea as a refreshing drink with this sweet and savory treat."
